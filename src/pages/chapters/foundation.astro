			<div class="max-w-4xl">
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					Okay, this might sound a bit pretentious, especially if you're not creating the next Apple but something simpler. At a product manager meetup, there was a common joke on this topic where students were given badges saying, «We own a vision.» It's commonly believed that you need to make money first and then think about mission, vision, and everything else.
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					There is indeed some sense in this, but I believe it's worth dedicating time and attention to this chapter. It's important for you as the product owner. This is a good way to think structurally about what you are going to do and the benefits it will bring. You might even realize that the product, as you initially envisioned it, doesn't need to be made at all, which is okay because you will save time and create something more worthwhile.
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					If you can clearly describe, first to yourself, what your product is and why you are making it, everything will be much simpler moving forward. You will have a foundation in which you believe and upon which you can rely.
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					Another unexpected benefit of going through this chapter is the ability to succinctly answer the question, «What do you do?» whether in an elevator meeting with an investor or chatting with a potential CTO over a beer.
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					Take this seriously; it's worth it.
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					There are many frameworks and models taught in universities, described in authoritative books, and discussed in academic circles, such as:
				</p>
				<ul class="body text-secondary mb-4 ml-6">
					<li>Value Proposition Canvas (VPC)</li>
					<li>SWOT Analysis</li>
					<li>Simon Sinek's Golden Circle</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					You can study these models independently if you wish, but in this chapter, we will leave them aside. We are bootstrapping with limited resources, not preparing for an MBA, right?
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					So, let's keep it simple, friends. Simple questions, common sense.

			<h2 class="h2 mb-4">Mission</h2>
			<div class="max-w-4xl">
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					A clear mission statement provides direction and defines the primary objective of the product.
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					Let's answer three questions:
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					One: <strong>What are we going to do?</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					Two: <strong>What problems are we solving?</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					Three: <strong>Why?</strong>
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					The idea of our product is to create an AI-powered tool that allows people to automatically generate responses to other users' posts. The tool will be flexible in its settings, allowing users to mimic their communication style and tone. Additionally, the tool will have a feature for automatically unfollowing users who do not follow back.
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					The tool is expected to be useful for users who are just starting to build a public account and need their first 1,000 followers.

					Clearer now, right? Now you have a succinct answer for a new acquaintance while the bartender pours a double Lagavulin. This amount of time is enough to explain what you do.
				</p>

					It's not necessary for the mission to follow the exact order of questions mentioned above. The main thing is that the mission is clear and concise.

				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					<strong>Henry Ford</strong>: I will build a motor car for the great multitude. It will be so low in price that no man making a good salary will be unable to own one and enjoy with his family the blessing of hours of pleasure in God's great open spaces. When I'm through, everybody will be able to afford one, and everyone will have one. The horse will have disappeared from our highways, the automobile will be taken for granted, and we will give a large number of men employment at good wages.
				</p>
				<p class="body text-secondary mb-4">
					<strong>Walt Disney</strong>: The idea of Disneyland is a simple one. It will be a place where people can find happiness and knowledge. It will be a place where parents and children can have fun together; a place where teachers and pupils can discover greater ways of understanding and education. Here the older generation can recapture the nostalgia of days gone by, and the younger generation can savor the challenge of the future. Disneyland will be a place where the wonders of Nature and Man can be seen and enjoyed, a place where we can learn and be inspired by the achievements, hopes, and dreams of the human race. Disneyland will be something of a fair, an exhibition, a playground, a community center, a museum of living facts, and a showplace of beauty and magic. It will be filled with the accomplishments, joys, and hopes of the world we live in and will remind us and show us how to make these wonders part of our own lives.
