# Urbi - Transforming Urban Mobility

## Project Overview

As Senior Product Designer at Urbi, I'm working on revolutionizing urban mobility in the UAE. The platform integrates multiple transportation modes into a seamless user experience.

## Key Responsibilities

- **User Experience Design** - Creating intuitive interfaces for complex mobility workflows
- **Design System** - Maintaining and evolving the design system across mobile and web
- **User Research** - Conducting usability studies with diverse user groups
- **Cross-platform Design** - Ensuring consistency across iOS, Android, and web platforms

## Design Challenges

### Multi-modal Integration
Designing seamless transitions between different transport modes (metro, bus, taxi, bike-sharing) while maintaining user context and preferences. This approach is similar to what I described in [[Design Systems 2025|my article about design systems]].

### Cultural Localization  
Adapting the interface for both Arabic and English users, considering RTL layouts, cultural preferences, and local transportation habits.

### Real-time Information
Displaying accurate, real-time information about multiple transport options while maintaining performance and readability.

## Results & Impact

The redesigned user experience has significantly improved key metrics:
- **40% increase** in journey completion rates
- **60% reduction** in customer support tickets  
- **3 cities** successfully launched with positive user feedback

## Technologies & Tools

- **Design**: Figma, Adobe Creative Suite
- **Prototyping**: Figma, Principle
- **Research**: UserTesting, Hotjar
- **Collaboration**: Slack, Notion, Jira
